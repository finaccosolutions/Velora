# Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Email Functionality Configuration
**Problem**: Order confirmation emails were not being sent to users or the owner after placing an order.

**Solution**:
- SMTP credentials are now properly configured to use environment variables from Supabase Edge Function secrets
- Created `SUPABASE_SECRETS_SETUP.md` with detailed instructions for adding the required secrets
- The Edge Function uses SMTP2GO API for reliable email delivery
- Emails are sent to both the customer and the owner (orders@veloratradings.com)

**Action Required**:
You need to add the following secrets in your Supabase Dashboard (Edge Functions > Manage Secrets):
- SMTP_HOST: `smtp.hostinger.com`
- SMTP_PORT: `465`
- SMTP_USER: `orders@veloratradings.com`
- SMTP_PASSWORD: Your SMTP API key from Hostinger
- SMTP_FROM_EMAIL: `orders@veloratradings.com`
- SMTP_FROM_NAME: `Velora Tradings`

See `SUPABASE_SECRETS_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

### 2. Wishlist Icon Not Clickable on Home Page
**Problem**: The wishlist heart icon on featured products on the home page was not clickable.

**Solution**:
- Adjusted z-index hierarchy in `FeaturedProducts.tsx`
- Moved the gradient overlay behind the wishlist button (z-10 for overlay, z-30 for button)
- Added proper event handlers with stopPropagation to prevent conflicts

**File Changed**: `src/components/FeaturedProducts.tsx`

### 3. Real-Time Cart Count Not Updating
**Problem**: After adding items to cart from the home page, the cart count in the header didn't update until the page was refreshed.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the useEffect dependency array in `useSupabaseCart.ts` to prevent stale closures
- Added immediate fetch after cart operations (addToCart)
- Improved real-time subscription with better logging
- The subscription now properly triggers re-renders when cart items change

**File Changed**: `src/hooks/useSupabaseCart.ts`

### 4. Real-Time Wishlist Count Not Updating
**Problem**: After adding items to wishlist, the wishlist count in the header didn't update until the page was refreshed.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the useEffect dependency array in `useSupabaseWishlist.ts` to prevent stale closures
- Added immediate fetch after wishlist operations (addToWishlist, removeFromWishlist)
- Improved real-time subscription with better logging
- The subscription now properly triggers re-renders when wishlist items change

**File Changed**: `src/hooks/useSupabaseWishlist.ts`

## Technical Details

### Real-Time Updates
Both cart and wishlist now use a dual approach for real-time updates:
1. **Immediate fetch**: After any add/remove operation, the hook immediately fetches the latest data
2. **Real-time subscription**: Listens for database changes and updates automatically

This ensures the UI updates immediately after user actions and also stays in sync if changes happen from other sources.

### Code Changes
- Removed `fetchCartItems` and `fetchWishlistItems` from useEffect dependency arrays to prevent infinite loops
- Added manual fetch calls after database operations
- Enhanced logging for debugging subscription status

## Build Status
âœ… Project builds successfully with all fixes applied

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test adding items to cart from both Products page and Home page
2. Verify cart count updates immediately in the header
3. Test adding/removing items from wishlist
4. Verify wishlist count updates immediately in the header
5. Click wishlist heart icon on featured products on home page
6. After configuring SMTP secrets, place a test order to verify emails are sent
