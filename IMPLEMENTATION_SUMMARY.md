# Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the enhancements made to the e-commerce platform, focusing on order management, email notifications, admin panel improvements, and site settings integration.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Order Placement Flow Fixed
**Issue:** After placing a cash-on-delivery order, users were redirected to the cart page instead of staying on the order success page.

**Solution:**
- Updated `src/pages/Checkout.tsx` to use `replace: true` in navigation
- Added `setIsProcessing(false)` before navigation to prevent state issues
- Users now stay on the order success page after placing an order

#### Database Configuration
- Created migration `add_email_settings` to store admin email in database
- Added `adminEmail` setting to `site_settings` table (default: shafeeqkpt@gmail.com)

#### Edge Function Updates
- Enhanced `send-order-email` edge function to fetch admin email from database
- Added `sendToAdmin` flag to automatically retrieve admin email from settings
- Falls back to default email if database setting is not found
- Deployed updated edge function to Supabase

#### Email Features
- Sends order confirmation emails to customers with:
  - Order details and items
